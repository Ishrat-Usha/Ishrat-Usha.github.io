        Hi! My name is Ishrat, pronounced (ish-rut). Welcome to my GitHub page where you can learn a little bit about me. 
      </p>
      
      </p>
        I’m a student from Baruch College, who will be receiving her diploma in Finance major/ philosophy minor in December of 2025, where I’ve taken several courses to strengthen my skills in communication, writing, research, and analytical thinking. Through both my time at college and my experience working in retail, pharmacy, and assisting, I’ve learned how to work face to face with diverse numbers of people from diverse backgrounds which has taught me how to stay calm under pressure, to pay attention to details, and to approach challenges with empathy. Both while working with kids and in retail I've had to face different circumtances which has taught me to be malleable to different situtions while still being able to form a bond of trust and understanding.
      </p>
      
       <p>
        I’m deeply passionate about my community and often advocate for the working class and anyone who is struggling and need a voice. While I haven’t been part of a large organizations yet, I’ve always tried to do my best in any way I can— whether it’s by spreading awareness, donating when I can, or prioritizing justice and compassion in the way I show up for others who need support. My main goal is to grow into someone who may be able to contribute on a bigger scale while working alongside knowledgable and likeminded individuals, and I’m eager to learn from people who are committed to public services. 
       </p>

        <p>
        I have a deep passion towards these position of work and strive to work alongside anyone with the same goal. This is one of the the main reason as to why I feel so connected to the cause of Mayor Zohran Mamdani and his team. The commitment to tenant rights, immigrant communities, affordable housing, and people-first policy making reflects the values I strive to support every day. To be able to consistantly show up for those who are most vulnerable and for those who need a voice, organizing with intent, and pushing for full structural change even when it’s difficult. Being a part of these kind of goals is what fuels my passion towards advocacy.
Even if my experience is still developing, my dedication, creativity, willingness to learn, and genuine care for my community are things I wholeheartedly bring with me in everything I do. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Outside of academics, I’m a film/photography enthusiast. I love capturing thoughtful visuals, editing cinematic-style videos, and telling stories through imagery. Creativity is a big part of who I am and I also enjoy being able to communicate ideas through them.
